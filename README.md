# 🚢 Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset using Python

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the famous **Titanic dataset** using Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib**.  
The goal is to uncover hidden patterns and insights from the dataset related to survival, passenger demographics, and class distribution.




## 📁 Dataset Used

- The dataset used is the **Titanic dataset** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data).
- It includes information about passengers such as:
  - Age, Gender, Class, Fare, Survival status, etc.



## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 🐍  
- Pandas 📊  
- NumPy 🔢  
- Seaborn 🎨  
- Matplotlib 📈



## 📊 Key Visualizations

- **Countplot** of survivors vs non-survivors  
- **Bar chart** of passengers by class  
- **Pie chart** showing survival ratio  
- **Histogram** of age distribution  
- And more insightful graphs revealing trends and correlations



## 📌 Learnings & Insights

- Found clear survival rate differences based on gender and passenger class
- Observed distribution of age and fare among different classes
- Visual patterns helped in understanding real-world classification problems



## 🚀 How to Run

You can explore the project in **Google Colab**. No setup required.
